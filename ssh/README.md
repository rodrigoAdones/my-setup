# SSH configutations

This is my *SSH config* file that allows me use multiple github identifiers in my laptop for different accounts.

The idea with this is use SSH files to avoid manage passwords in each repository.

### Where

Use in your SSH folder

### Note

Before start using this configuration it is recomended run the command *ssh-add* to register the identity.

```bash
ssh-add {identity}
```
